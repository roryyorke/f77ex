#  This re-uses the build directory, including CMake config, and is
#  fastest when doing iterative development.
#
#  The downside is that this is somewhat fragile: although the build
#  tools (scikit-build-core, CMake, and ninja) are pretty good about
#  detecting and handling changes to the source, they're not perfect,
#  and one can end up with apparently impossible results that go away
#  when doing a clean build.
