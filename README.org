Demonstrate creating a Python wheel from Fortran source linked against
https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs

* manylinux build

Needs bash and docker.  Tested on Debian 13 x64 host.  Includes auditwheel step.

Run ~./ci/docker-build.bash~ to build ~f77ex-0.0.1-cp313-cp313-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl~.

* cibuildwheel

** basic check

~CIBW_BUILD=cp313-manylinux_x86_64 cibuildwheel~

** Windows

 - compile with Ninja, gcc, gfortran via SKBUILD_CMAKE_ARGS
   - perhaps using ninja or make one can still use msvc - does it matter?

 - wheel repair
   - happens after build environment deleted
   - install scipy_openblas32
   - install delvewheel
   - use delvewheel_wrapper.py to manipulate PATH to find scipy_openblas DLL
