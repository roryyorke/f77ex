Demonstrate creating a Python wheel from Fortran source linked against
https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs

Needs bash and docker.  Tested on Debian 13 x64 host.

Run ~./ci/docker-build.bash~ to build ~f77ex-0.0.1-cp313-cp313-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl~.

* Tasks

** TODO renaming symbols (DGETRF -> SCIPY_DGETRF, etc.)

Via preprocessor, or modifying .o files, or something else?

Does scipy-openblas only support gfortran?

** TODO Windows

Use fortran?  How to ensure the right compiler is used?
