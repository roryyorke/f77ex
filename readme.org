Demonstrates linking against the scipy_openblas32 wheel.

As of b6a4d44, it builds and runs.

* TODO vendor in openblas libs

kind of hinky, but:
  - install the 3 libraries (Cmake install, that is)
  - and ~-rpath=${ORIGIN}~ to build

No python code in the wheel!

* TODO auditwheel? repairwheel? whatever?

this wants me to use an older compiler (or runtime, or whatever).
